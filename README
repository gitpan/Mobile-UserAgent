Mobile::UserAgent
=================

Description
-----------
Parses a mobile user agent string into it's basic constituent parts, the
most important being vendor and model.

One reason for doing this would be to use this information to lookup
vendor-model specific device characteristics in a database. You can use also
use user agent profiles to do this (for which I've developed other classes),
but not all mobile phones have these, especially the older types.
Another reason would be to detect if the visiting client is a mobile handset.

Only real mobile user-agent strings can be parsed succesfully by this class.
Most WAP emulators are not supported because they usually don't use the same
user-agent strings as the devices they emulate.
